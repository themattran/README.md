### Tips 

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`v`, `v`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which can launch using the `node` command in vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows. 

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry); 
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
